        <p>Well! For some reason you've landed on my personal webpage, I've no idea what could've brought you here but now that you've 
            arrived I may as well tell you a bit about myself. I'm Conor Dyson, originally
             from Poulacapple East on the border of Tipperary and Kilkenny, Ireland. I’m now 
             based in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I'm pursuing my PhD at the Niels Bohr Institute,
              University of Copenhagen. My interests broadly lie in black hole perturbation theory but 
              more specifically in applying the self-force formalism to model extreme and intermediary 
              mass ratio inspirals in the strong gravity regime. Be that in terms of including the 
              leading order non-linear effects of the self-force or in terms of including the effects of 
              the environment on the motion of the small body. So if any of that sounds of interest take
            a seat back and relax, I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        As I said above, I'm originally from Poulacapple East, a small village on the border of 
        Tipperary and Kilkenny in Ireland. I grew up in a rural area, but attended school at St. Kierans 
        College in Kilkenny where I was fortunate to always have excellent 
        teachers such as Joey Kavanagh and Carl Lynch whose own clear passion for maths and 
        sciences was a fantastic driver for me. I completed my undergraduate degree at University College 
        Dublin, where I then went on to attend Homerton College at the University of Cambridge where I completed 
        the Part III masters program in the Department of Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics. This brings us to Copenhagen 
        where I am now based as a PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this page is supposed to be about me now — my research, beyond my passion for physics, I love playing and watching rugby. Growing 
        up on the border of Munster and Leinster, I got to choose my club — and given my hot take 
        that Prendergast can tackle and lose his team's games, and Crowley is the clear choice at 10,
        you can probably guess which route I took. I play for the CSR Nanok rugby team in Christianhavn, Copenhagen. 
        <br>

        Joining and playing for this club has honestly been one of the greatest joys of my time in
        Copenhagen, between the cold dark winter nights training on frozen astroturf to the sunny league games in Aalborg with 
        a fantastic group of people, it's been a pleasure to be a part of.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the annoyance of my roommates in recent years I have also taken up playing 
        the Anglo concertina, but somehow we've even managed to organise a trad session with people from the Institute! Maybe we'll be ready for a gig in the Niels Bohr Institute pub soon enough!
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of my other interests outside of physics, I have a passion for art and music. Some of my favorite artists include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fontaines D.C.</strong> – "Bug"</li>
        <li><strong>Arctic Monkeys</strong> – "Do I Wanna Know?"</li>
        <li><strong>Lisa O'Neill</strong> – "All the Tired Horses"</li>
        <li><strong>Hak Baker</strong> – "Windrush Baby"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Also some paintings I've taken a particular liking to over the years include:</p>      
      <ul>
        <li>Carl Bloch — <em>In a Roman Osteria</em></li>
        <li>Jan Matejko — <em>Stańczyk</em></li>
        <li>Caspar David Friedrich — <em>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My work focuses on gravitational self-force in both vacuum spacetimes and those with material environments. I aim to develop self-consistent models for the evolution of small bodies in curved spacetimes, with an eye toward physical interpretation and numerical tractability.</p>
